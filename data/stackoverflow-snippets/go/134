    Common durations. There is no definition for units of Day or larger to avoid
    confusion across daylight savings time zone transitions.

    To count the number of units in a Duration, divide:

    second := time.Second
    fmt.Print(int64(second/time.Millisecond)) // prints 1000

    To convert an integer number of units to a Duration, multiply:

    seconds := 10
    fmt.Print(time.Duration(seconds)*time.Second) // prints 10s
